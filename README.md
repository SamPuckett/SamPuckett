# About me
Hello! I'm Sam, a Software Engineer based in Modesto, California who enjoys designing things on the web. I am passionate about web development and creating products that users can easily use without having to think.

During my tenure at Stanislaus State University, I attended many hackathons and even won some! That's how I fell in love working with React and JavaScript!

As a Google Developer Group Organizer and Developer Student Club Officer at Stanislaus State I had the opportunity to run workshops at my university. This allowed me to teach the topics that I was passionate about to my fellow colleagues. 
This position also allowed me to learn from leaders @ Google and others who are part of the Google Developer Group around North America!

Aside from Web Development I also enjoy Pizza! üçï
